- `sw.js` in root (required for service worker registration)
- Proper asset paths for caching

### ✅ **Professional Structure**

- Follows web development best practices
- Easy for other developers to understand
- Scalable for future features

## 🔧 File Paths Updated

- `css/style.css` → `assets/css/style.css`
- `js/script.js` → `assets/js/script.js`
- `js/auth.js` → `assets/js/auth.js`

## 🚀 Ready to Use
